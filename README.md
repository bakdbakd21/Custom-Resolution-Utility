## Custom Resolution Utility 2025

Custom Resolution Utility (CRU) is a program that allows you to create custom resolutions for your monitor, as long as they are supported.

The application isn't perfect, but if your monitor can support higher and/or different resolutions from what's displayed in your graphics control panel, Custom Resolution Utility will create EDID values in the registry so that you may select the resolutions in your graphics settings.
